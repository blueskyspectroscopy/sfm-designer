# SFM Designer Docs

This tool is based on the work of Christiansen <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />
in the modeling of range-resolved interferometers based on sinusoidal optical
frequency modulation (SFM). It is recommended to read chapter 3 of Christiansen
<Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />, and the following assumptions are made in
the tool based on that work:

- The Gaussian window function of equations 3.9 and 3.31 of Christiansen
  <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" /> is applied. A width of &sigma; = 0.0225 is
  used as recommended by Kissinger et al. <Ref name="kissinger2015range" />.
- The band separation coefficient of w = 2.5 is used as recommended by
  equation 3.40 by Christiansen <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />.

## Parameters

These are the parameters that can be entered into the model.

- <NuA /> is the amplitude of the optical frequency modulation. For example, a
  <NuA /> of 1 GHz means that the laser is modulated &pm;1 GHz about its
  central frequency.
- <FM /> is the modulation frequency, which is the rate of the sinusoidal
  optical frequency modulation.
- The number of measurements refers to how many independent measurements are
  desired. Note that this is not equal to the number of interference axes, and
  will always be less than the total number of axes (refer to section 3.2.1 of
  Christiansen <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />).
- Configuration describes the overall interferometer layout.
  - Shared Reference: the same interferometric reference is used for all
    measurements. This has the advantage of generating simpler interferometers;
    however, it carries the disadvantage that optical paths must often be made
    up in fiber to achieve the desired band spacing, making the measurements
    much more temperature sensitive.
  - Unique References: separate interferometric references are used for each
    measurement. This has the advantages of increased flexibility and reduced
    temperature sensitivity, but the disadvantages of increased complexity and
    a greater required signal processing bandwidth.
- <XSep /> is the spacing in mechanical path between interference axes. This is
  computed automatically using equation 3.42 in Christiansen
  <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />. It can optionally be overridden; however,
  this is not recommended for inexperienced users.
- The solution is the normalized solution set described in section 3.4 of
  Christiansen <Ref name="christiansen2024phd" />. The solution is normalized
  by <XSep />, and represents the relative lengths of all paths through the
  interferometer. There are infinitely many solutions to any configuration;
  however, only the solutions with the smallest optical lengths are shown.
